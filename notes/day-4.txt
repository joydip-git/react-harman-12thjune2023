TypeScript:
1. super set of JS
2. is development ONLY language
3. provides static type checking and type annotation (strict data typing)
4. it has all the new features of ES
5. at the top of that it provides many extra features, data types etc. also
	Note: all those extra features are never transpiled to JS
6. you need a tool to transpile TS code back to JS code: typescript transpiler (executable - tsc)

extra fetaures:
a. data type: any, unknown, partial etc.
b. class:
	access specifiers for data and functionalities
c. interface
d. custom data type using 'type' keyword and creating data type for functions
e. generic types can be declared in TS

type inference:
understanding the type of variable/identifier from assigned value


configuration of JS application:
done through a JSON file: package.json
this file should always be there at the root of the application directory
can be created manually or using NPM tool
>npm init
or
>npm init --yes

install typescript transpiler:
>npm i typescript --save-dev [dev dependency]
>npm i package-name --save [complete dependency]

or

>npm i typescript -D [dev dependency]
>npm i package-name [complete dependency]

audit packages:
>npm audit

fix issues:
>npm audit fix --force

package managers:
a. NPM: Node Packager Manager
folder for packages => node_mdoules


b. yarn: folder for packages => node_mdoules

c. bower: folder for packages => bower_components

creating typescript config file:
>.\node_modules\.bin\tsc --init

TS/JS-based Application development:

A. Development mode:

a. preparation:
1. create application folder
2. create package.json file (using npm command)
3. install necesary packages
4. create a directory for your source code
5. create an HTML file at the root of your application directory
6. configure some extrnal tools if required
7. write scripts if necessary

b. coding:
complete coding. always have a main file (like index.js/ts).

c. post-coding:
1. transpile your code
2. bundle your code
3. link the transpiled files to HTML
4. host your application through an application development server
