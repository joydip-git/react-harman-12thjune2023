1. Routing:

localhost:3000 =>      		  		Home
localhost:3000/home => 		  		Home
localhost:3000/products =>    		ProductList [ProductRow + FilterProduct]
localhost:3000/products/view/:id =>   ViewProduct
localhost:3000/products/edit/:id =>   EditProduct
localhost:3000/products/add =>  	AddProduct

localhost:3000/<invalid-path> =>    PageNotFound

Router: engine who can read URL (routes) from and write to the browser address bar as well as redirect you to that route
a. BrowserRouter
b. HashRouter
c. MemoryRouter


Next JS:
	app
		page.tsx (root file)
		
		- products (folder)
			page.tsx (root file => ProductList)
			
			- add (folder)
				page.tsx (root file => AddProduct)
			- edit
				page.tsx (root file => EditProduct)
			- viewproduct
				- [route-parameter-name]
					page.tsx (root file => ViewProduct)
